                    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                    <p>It's a miracle my cats or I haven't gotten oil paint all over my apartment carpets (or did I just jinx itâ€¦). I've always loved art and fell in love with oil painting in college, but it quickly fell to the wayside. But I've finally gotten back to painting in my free time. Luckily, my other hobbies like reading, enjoying Formula One, and traveling are much less messy. I'm currently making my way down the list of visiting every MLB stadium and just made my first international trips to Nepal and Canada!</p>
