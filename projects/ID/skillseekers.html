                    <p>I worked with a member of Veterans United's People Development Team to create an online counterpart to their popular instructor lead training "Skill Seekers: How to Get Better at Getting Better." I utilized videos and worksheets in a way our team hadn't done before to mimic the kind of engagement you normally only get from being in-person.</p>

                    <p class="no-margin"><span>DATE:</span> October 2024</p>
                    <p class="no-margin"><span>PROJECT ATTRIBUTES:</span> Copy Writing & Editing, Adobe After Effects, Graphic Design</p>
                    <p class="no-margin"><span>RESULT:</span> The SME was thrilled with the result calling it "just as interactive and engaging as the in-person version!" It's now used as a part of New Hire Orientation in place of the in-person training at VU's other Missouri, Kansas, and Texas locations.</p>
